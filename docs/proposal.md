# Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

Target audience: Space enthusiasts, amateur astronomers, and anyone interested in meteorites.

Meteorites are fascinating objects that have always captivated the imagination of people interested in space and astronomy. The NASA Meteorite Landings dataset is an incredible resource for exploring meteorite landings all around the world. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide a user-friendly platform for exploring this dataset and to help users visualize and understand the distribution of meteorites on Earth.

# Section 2: Description of the Data

The Meteorite Landings dataset from NASA contains information about meteorites that have landed on Earth. The dataset includes over 45,000 records of meteorite landings with information such as the location, mass, year of the landing, and the classification of the meteorite. The data is organized by country, state/province, and location.

# Section 3: Research Questions

The following research questions will be explored in the dashboard:
- Where are the majority of meteorite landings located on Earth?
- How has the number of meteorite landings changed over time?
- What is the size distribution of meteorites on Earth?

# Section 4: Proposed Visualizations

The following visualizations will be included in the dashboard:
- **Map**: A world map that shows the location of meteorite landings with markers representing the size of the meteorites.
- **Histogram**: A histogram that shows the number of meteorite landings in each continent on Earth.
- **Line plot**: A line plot that shows the number of meteorite landings plotted against time in years.

Users will be able to filter the data by year range, meteorite size range, country, and state/province. The filters will allow users to explore specific subsets of the data and gain insights into the distribution of meteorites on Earth.
The dashboard will be interactive and user-friendly, allowing space enthusiasts, amateur astronomers, and anyone interested in meteorites to explore the fascinating world of meteorites on Earth.
